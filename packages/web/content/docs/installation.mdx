# Installation

Fatcn is currently in beta and is optimized for Next.js projects using TypeScript. It provides a collection of ready-to-use UI components with a modern design system.

## Quick Start

To get started with Fatcn, run the following command in your Next.js project:

```bash
npx fatcn-ui init
```

This command will:
```txt
1. Install all necessary dependencies
2. Copy UI components to your `components` directory
3. Add required styles to your `global.css` file
4. Update your `tailwind.config.ts` with the required configuration
```

## Example Usage

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Requirements

- Next.js project
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

## Beta Notice

Please note that Fatcn is currently in beta. While we're actively working on improvements, you might encounter occasional issues. For the best experience, we recommend using it with Next.js + TypeScript projects.

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please feel free to contribute to our GitHub repository.
