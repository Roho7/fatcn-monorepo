# How It Works

Fatcn takes a different approach to component installation compared to other UI libraries. Instead of installing components in `node_modules`, fatcn installs all components as `.tsx` files directly in your codebase.

## Installation Process

When you run the installation command, fatcn performs several automated steps:

### Component Installation

Fatcn looks for a `components` directory in your project root. If it doesn't find one, it automatically creates it. All UI components are then copied into this directory.

Currently fatcn doesn't support adding components one by one. It installs everything in one go. You can choose to delete the components you don't need. The `add` command is in the works.

### Tailwind Configuration

Fatcn automatically updates your `tailwind.config` file to include necessary design tokens and theme configurations:

- Adds custom colors and their variations
- Configures animation properties
- Sets up border radius values
- Defines spacing scales
- Adds typography configurations

If the configuration file doesn't exist, fatcn will create one with all required settings.

### CSS Variables

Fatcn also modifies (or creates) your `globals.css` file to include essential CSS variables that power the theming system:

- Adds color variables for light and dark modes
- Sets up background color variables
- Configures border colors
- Defines text colors and their variations
- Includes animation timing variables

These CSS variables work in conjunction with the Tailwind configuration to provide a consistent theming system across your application.
