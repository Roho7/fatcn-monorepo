# Command box

A command box is a non-intrusive, brief notification that provides feedback or updates without disrupting the userâ€™s workflow.

## Usage

<ComponentPreview name='command_box' />

### With dialog box

<ComponentPreview name='command_box_dialog' />

## Design Guidelines

- Keep messages concise and action-oriented.
- Position toasts consistently, typically at the top-right or bottom-center of the screen.
- Use appropriate colors to reflect the message type (e.g., success, error, info, warning).
- Auto-dismiss toasts after a few seconds, with an option for manual dismissal.
- Ensure toasts are responsive and do not obscure critical content.

## Accessibility

- Configurable timeouts for automatic removal.
- Allows buttons or links within the toast.
- Displays multiple toasts in an organized, non-overlapping manner.
- Includes ARIA roles and proper focus management for usability.
